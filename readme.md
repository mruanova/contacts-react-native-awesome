you can use "react-native init" with the newer version of npm, although if you're just trying to run Thomas' app you shouldn't have to do that (edited)

from the screenshot looks like you're using `create-react-native-app`, which allows you to use expo, I chose to forgo that option and used `react-native-cli`

the install instructions for `react-native-cli` are under the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab
