you can use "react-native init" with the newer version of npm,


from the screenshot looks like you're using `create-react-native-app`, which allows you to use expo, I chose to forgo that option and used `react-native-cli`


the install instructions for `react-native-cli` are under the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab
